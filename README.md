# Kannada-Mnist

This is a machine learning project using Deep Neural Networks with Keras, and more specifically, a classification problem for the prediction of hand-written digits. 

## Source
The dataset used is an alternative one with regard to the popular MNIST digits, and the project was constructed in the context of a [kaggle class competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs98x-kannada-mnist) in the module CS98 Machine Learning, at the Strathclyde University (academic year 2019-20).

## Purpose
The prediction of hand-written digits
