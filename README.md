# Kannada-Mnist

This is a machine learning project using Deep Neural Networks with Keras, and more specifically, a classification problem for the prediction of hand-written digits. 

## Source
The dataset used is an alternative one with regard to the popular [MNIST digits](https://conx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MNIST.html) dataset, and the project was constructed in the context of a [kaggle class competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs98x-kannada-mnist) in the module CS98 Machine Learning, at the Strathclyde University (academic year 2019-20).

["Kannada"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada) is a language spoken predominantly by people of Karnataka in southwestern India. The language has roughly 45 million native speakers and is written using the Kannada script

The format is similar to MNIST in terms of how the data is structured.

## Purpose
The classification of the images of hand-written digits, and the prediction of those numbers.

## Description
A range of deep neural network architectures and techniques are applied with the final goal of finding the optimal model for the digits' predictions.
